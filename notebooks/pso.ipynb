    "One of the most studied problems in the ﬁnancial investment expert system is the intractability of port-folios. The non-linear constrained portfolio optimization problem with multi-objective functions cannot be efﬁciently  solved  using traditionally  approaches.  This  paper  presents  a  meta-heuristic  approach  to portfolio optimization problem using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique.  The PSO model demonstrates high computational efﬁciency in constructing optimal  risky  portfolios.  Preliminary  results  show  that  the  approach  is  very  promising  and  achieves results comparable or superior with the state of the art solvers. "
